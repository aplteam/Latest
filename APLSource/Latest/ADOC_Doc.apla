 '## Overview'
 ''
 '`]Latest` is designed to list the latest changes.'
 ''
 ' The main purpose of `]Latest` is to act on LINKed namespaces/their directores (no argument required at all).'
 '                            '
 'However, it can do more than that:'
 ''
 '* It can act on unlinked namespaces, meaning that you need to specify something like `#` or `âŽ•SE` or `#.Foo`'
 ''
 '  This limits `]Latest` powers, because scripts (classes, interfaces, scripted namespaces) do not own a timestamp '
 '  that could be used. (When acting on the file system the file time stamp can be used instead)'
 ''
 '* It can act on any un-linked folder like `C:\MyProjects\ThisProject\APLSource`'
 ''
 'By default the user command reports all objects or files changed lately (read: last day anything was changed).'
 '  '
 'Note that in case a path or the `allFiles` flag was specified, all files in .git/ or its sub-directories are removed'
 'from the result since the user will almost never be interested in them while its inclusion would eat a lot of time.'
 ''
 '## The argument(s)'
 ''
 'When an argument is specified it must be one of:'
 ''
 '* An integer'
 '  * A positive one smaller than 10000000 (1E7) defines the number of APL objects/files to be listed.'
 '  * A positive integer larger than 9999999 is treated as a specific date (YYYYMMDD).'
 '  * A negative one defines the number of days with any changes. (Deprecated: use -days= instead)'
 '* A character vector; if it contains a `/` or a `\` it is treated as a directory, otherwise as a namespace path'
 '* A vector of length two with an integer and a character vector in no particular order, see above.'
 ''
 'In case no argument or only an integer is specified, `]Latest` will establish which namespaces are currently LINKed.'
 'If it is just one it will act on it. If there are multiple LINKs established, the user will be prompted.'
 ''
 'Note that by default `]Latest` identifies Tatin package API namespaces and ignores everything within them. '
 'This can  be changed by specififying `-noAPI=0`.'
 ''
 '## FLags (options)        '
 ''
 '`-allFiles`'
 ''
 ': By default only files with extensions that are recognized as APL source files (`.aplf`, `.aplc` etc.) are'
 '  listed. You can force `]Latest` to consider all files by specifying this flag.'
 '  '
 ''
 '`-days=`'
 ''
 ': Use this to specify the number of days changes should be reported on. Don''t specify an integer as argument in case'
 '  you use this. If you do anyway, the integer will be ignored.'
 ''
 '  '
 '`-recursive=0|1`'
 ''
 ': The default is 1, meaning that the path is searched recursively;'
 '  if you don''t want this then specify a 0.'
 '  '
 '`-noAPI=0|1`'
 ''
 ': The default is 1, meaning that the Tatin package API is ignored, if any.'
 '  If you include them specify don''t want this then specify a 0.'
 '       '
 '  '
 '`-stats`'
 ''
 ': If this flag is specified you get a matrix with two columns, the first'
 '  one with all unique dates and the second one with the number of objects changed '
 '  on that day. The number of rows is defined by the number of unique dates.'
 ''
 ': If `-stats` is specified any other flag will be ignored.'
 '  '
 ''
 '`-version`'
 ''
 ': Ignores any other flag and prints the version to the session'
 ''
