# Latest

The general idea of the `Latest` user command is to list the latest changes the user made to the APL code.

In case there are acre projects open the command acts towards this/those, but if their aren't any, or if the user specifies something different, one can list the latests changes in a particular namespace or in the workspace as a whole.
